# Assignment 3 - Writeup

Assignment 3 is all about creating this natural language query system.  In order to do so, you have to write a lot of functions to retrieve infomation.  You will also have to write a function to return answers from a pattern-action list.  There is a lot of work to accomplish in this assignment, but this portion is intended for you to write about what you accomplished.

## Reflection Questions
1. In your own words describe the `search_pa_list` function.
    > search_pa_list is a function that when a prompt is inputted into the function that fits the format of it's listed questions, it'll extract the necesarry information from the prompt in order to use other functions to aggregate a list for the user.

2. What movie did you add to the `movies.py` file?  What year was it made? Any specific reason you added that movie?
    > I added Stuart little which was made in 1999. I added this because it is a cherished childhood film with many good laughs for all of the family, young and old alice.

3. What pattern / action did you add to the paList data structure?  Why do you think that is a useful pattern / action?
> I added one that asked in a more streamlined way for what actors would be in a specific movie. I did this because I felt like the other patterns were a little clunky and maybe long so I wanted to make a quicker pattern to type and possibly be easier to understand.
4. What is chatbot would you create that would be like this?  Describe why you would create it and what it would do.
> I think that I would create a bot that allows you to sift through historical events and see years, leaders, wars at the time, etc.

5. What was the most difficult portion of this assignment?
> The most difficult part of this assignment for me was figuring out how to do the actual pattern action function as it required many moving parts. I was able to understand how I would do it though.


6. Did you write a new assert for your pattern action?
> I did not write an assert for my new pattern action because I just used the query in order to check to see if it works.
